A Network Monitoring System (NMS), composed of a centralized server (NMS Server) and multiple distributed agents (NMS Agents), developed in Python by implementing two custom application-layer protocols: NetTask (UDP) for metrics collection and AlertFlow (TCP) for critical event notifications.

**Learning Outcomes**

- Protocol Design: Designed and implemented custom UDP and TCP-based communication protocols (NetTask and AlertFlow).
- Distributed System Architecture: Built a scalable client-server model with multiple agents and centralized server coordination.
- Resilient Communication: Developed mechanisms for reliability over unreliable networks, including manual retransmissions.
- Network Simulation: Tested the system under realistic conditions using the CORE network simulator.
- Real-Time Monitoring Interface: Created a command-line user interface with curses for live network status visualization and management.
